# Extracting drug-drug interactions from texts with BioBERT and multiple entity-aware attentions

This problem was approached from multiple methods that can be classified into two big groups: classic machine learning and deep neural networks. From recent studies, we found that best results are achieved by the various architectures of deep neural networks.

In order to choose one method to be our representative state-of-the-art, we will take into consideration the F1 metric as the ordering element.
